A simple Ncurses wrap for C++

The idea is to simplify basic use of Ncurses by wrapping it in a C++ class. 
This attempt is not aiming to be complete. It includes the parts I find useful
and tries to make them accessible. It is mainly for my own use and educational 
purposes. If you need a wrap there are likely better and more complete attempts
out there.
